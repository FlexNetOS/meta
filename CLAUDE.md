## Project Architecture: Meta-Repo (NOT a monorepo)

This is a **meta-repo** — a workspace of independent git repositories managed by the `meta` CLI tool. Each directory listed in `.meta` (the project config) is a **separate git repo** with its own remote, commits, and history.

**Critical rules:**
- NEVER assume this is a monorepo. There is no single shared git history.
- Each workspace member (e.g., `meta_cli/`, `meta_core/`, `loop_lib/`) is its own git repo cloned from its own GitHub remote.
- The root `.gitignore` ignores all child repos because they are NOT part of the parent repo.
- The root `Cargo.toml` defines a Rust workspace for local development convenience, but each member builds and publishes independently.
- When creating a new crate/package, it MUST be initialized as a separate git repo, pushed to GitHub under `gitkb/`, and added to both `.meta` (projects config) and `.gitignore`.

**Project config (`.meta.yaml`):**
```yaml
projects:
  meta_cli:
    repo: git@github.com:gitkb/meta_cli.git
  meta_core:
    repo: git@github.com:gitkb/meta_core.git
```

**Nested meta repos:** Use `meta: true` when a child project contains its own `.meta.yaml`:
```yaml
projects:
  open-source:
    repo: git@github.com:org/open-source.git
    meta: true  # This directory has its own .meta.yaml
```

This enables recursive operations:
```bash
meta git update          # Clones nested meta repos automatically
meta project list -r     # Shows full tree
meta exec -r cargo test  # Runs across all nested repos
```

**What `meta` does:** Clones all child repos, runs commands across them in parallel (`meta exec`), manages git worktrees across the entire workspace (`meta worktree`), and provides project-level coordination.

## Logging & Debugging

The meta CLI uses the `log` crate with `env_logger`. Use `RUST_LOG` to control debug output:

```bash
# Debug the host CLI
RUST_LOG=meta=debug meta git push

# Debug the git plugin (subprocess)
RUST_LOG=meta_git_cli=debug meta git push

# Debug everything
RUST_LOG=debug meta git push

# Debug specific modules
RUST_LOG=meta_git_cli::ssh_setup=debug meta git push
```

**Crate names for RUST_LOG:**
- `meta` - Host CLI (meta_cli)
- `meta_git_cli` - Git plugin
- `meta_project_cli` - Project plugin
- `meta_rust_cli` - Rust plugin
- `meta_git_lib` - Git library
- `loop_lib` - Command execution library

**Architecture:** Subprocess plugins initialize their own logger via `meta_plugin_protocol::run_plugin()`, inheriting `RUST_LOG` from the parent process.

# RTK (Rust Token Killer) - Token-Optimized Commands

## Golden Rule

**Always prefix commands with `rtk`**. If RTK has a dedicated filter, it uses it. If not, it passes through unchanged. This means RTK is always safe to use.

**Important**: Even in command chains with `&&`, use `rtk`:
```bash
# ❌ Wrong
git add . && git commit -m "msg" && git push

# ✅ Correct
rtk git add . && rtk git commit -m "msg" && rtk git push
```

## RTK Commands by Workflow

### Build & Compile (80-90% savings)
```bash
rtk cargo build         # Cargo build output
rtk cargo check         # Cargo check output
rtk cargo clippy        # Clippy warnings grouped by file (80%)
rtk tsc                 # TypeScript errors grouped by file/code (83%)
rtk lint                # ESLint/Biome violations grouped (84%)
rtk prettier --check    # Files needing format only (70%)
rtk next build          # Next.js build with route metrics (87%)
```

### Test (60-99% savings)
```bash
rtk cargo test          # Cargo test failures only (90%)

```

### Git (59-80% savings)
```bash
rtk git status          # Compact status
rtk git log             # Compact log (works with all git flags)
