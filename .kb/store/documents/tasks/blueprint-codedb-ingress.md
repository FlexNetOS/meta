## Overview

Component task in the blueprint-ingestion stream (parent: [[tasks/blueprint-ingestion-epic]]). Implements the
`codedb-ingress` component of
`/home/flexnetos/meta/src/lifeos/Architecture_Data_Pipeline_Blueprint_RUVECTOR_FULLY_EXPANDED_VERIFIED.md`.
Staged by Fable 5 for execution by Codex; claim by moving status to `active`.

## Context

- **Execution order:** 7 (from the blueprint's numbered install/activation order, RV§17 / integration table). Do not start implementation before lower-numbered component tasks have their gates green; work within the same order number may run concurrently.
- **Depends on component tasks:** [[tasks/blueprint-rtk-rtk-nu-envelope]], [[tasks/blueprint-postgres-ruvector-store]], [[tasks/blueprint-redb-state-plane]], [[tasks/blueprint-envctl-committer-security]]
- **Binding constraints:** the blueprint's 21 HARD EXECUTION RULES and 19 Operational invariants govern this task in full; the broader interpretation governs every ambiguity, and an edit conflicting with them is invalid. Read the blueprint sections named per obligation below before implementing.
- **Machine-readable source:** row(s) T001, T014, T027, T028, T057, T124, T125, T146, T172, T173 in `/home/flexnetos/meta/src/lifeos/reports/blueprint-task-graph.tsv`.
- **Operating constraint (owner directive):** previously completed planning-spine tasks and green test suites are untrusted claims until independently audited — lead with verification, not assumption.
- VERIFY-FIRST: completed task `tasks/yzx-iso/t4-7-byte-complete` claims byte-complete verification; R17 addendum records `codedb ingest-envelope` implemented at nu_plugin @931d48f (schema codedb.ingest-envelope.v0) with the release gate NOT narrowed, and R19 flags R08 unverified against that revision. Independent audit first.

## Obligations (full detail)

### T001 · §1.1 · Record bootstrap as database import sessions

The ordered bootstrap (Nix, envctl, Nu, CodeDB, importers, migration utilities) must be recorded as PostgreSQL/RuVector import sessions from its first byte, capturing raw bytes with complete structure, semantics, metadata, history, identity, ownership, timestamps, transformations, and provenance.

*Verification:* Verify import sessions exist in DB covering bootstrap from first byte; TBD query

### T014 · §3.2 · Wire native Nushell ingestion bypassing rtk

Path: native Nu command/value → typed Nu pipeline → required `codedb ingest-envelope` child command → redb owner. Native typed values bypass rtk and rtk_nu because a text compressor would lose type fidelity.

*Verification:* Native Nu value ingested with type fidelity preserved; no rtk hop

### T027 · §3.4 · Verify and canonicalize raw objects in CodeDB

CodeDB decodes each envelope payload, verifies length and digest, stores or deduplicates the exact bytes, assigns the canonical `raw_object_id`, and returns that identity in the typed receipt before accepting the typed/compact linkage; compact or typed representations supplement but never replace raw objects.

*Verification:* Ingest duplicate payloads; verify dedup, digest check, and receipt with raw_object_id

### T028 · §3.4 · Implement codedb ingest-envelope plugin command

The pinned CodeDB plugin registers only scan/capture/materialize/import/query commands with Nothing inputs; `codedb ingest-envelope` with typed record/list/table input and a typed receipt output is an explicit release-blocking addition. After implementation, Nushell invokes the plugin child which validates the envelope, links raw objects, and persists through the redb-owner client contract. Nu 0.113.1 typed boundaries are `from json --objects`, `from json`, `from nuon`.

*Verification:* `rtk_nu --format jsonl -- <cmd> | from json --objects | codedb ingest-envelope` returns typed receipt

### T057 · RV§2 · Build CodeDB workspace binaries

Build the nu_plugin/CodeDB workspace (codedb, codedb-cargo, codedb-context, codedb-core, codedb-fixtures, codedb-build-capture, codedb-mcp, codedb-rust-static, codedb-store-redb, codedb-store-pg, nu_plugin_codedb) producing bins codedb, codedb-mcp, and nu_plugin_codedb against Nu 0.113.1 with redb/PostgreSQL stores.

*Verification:* three bins build and nu_plugin_codedb registers with Nu 0.113.1

### T124 · RV§14 · Implement CodeDB BlobStore with PG/redb parity

The CodeDB BlobStore contract has PostgreSQL and redb implementations with differential round-trip behavior; it imports complete directory trees, file bytes, binaries, BOMs, symlinks, modes, paths, ownership metadata, source identity, checksums, and provenance; Cargo/static analysis and build capture add crates, workspaces, feature resolution, rustc/cargo messages, ASTs, symbols, types, dependencies, diagnostics, artifacts, and command exhaust.

*Verification:* Redb/PostgreSQL parity: identical hashes, metadata, paths, modes, symlinks, BOMs, and binary reconstruction

### T125 · RV§14 · Wire the live typed ingress route

Implement: immutable raw object/frame refs + Nu value + typed table + identity + provenance → Nushell 0.113.1 invokes nu_plugin_codedb → MessagePack plugin frames → CodeDB core and build/static/context enrichers → flexnetos-redb-owner client protocol → redb 4.1 transaction/event → envctl validation/authorization/ordered reconciliation → codedb-store-pg mapping over postgres/rustls → PostgreSQL byte objects + relational rows + RuVector projections → typed query result through the same plugin process. codedb, codedb-mcp, and nu_plugin_codedb share object identities; rtk adds compact views; rtk_nu supplies the byte-first envelope with raw-object linkage; original logs/blobs stay attached.

*Verification:* Typed round trip through nu_plugin_codedb returns the committed identity with raw-object linkage

### T146 · RV§17 · Implement codedb ingest-envelope and prove commit isolation (step 7)

Implement the missing typed `codedb ingest-envelope` pipeline command and redb-owner client backend; build CodeDB/nu_plugin with redb and PostgreSQL stores; run blob-store parity; register nu_plugin_codedb through isolated Nushell configuration; prove Nu/MessagePack typed round trip, raw-byte object linkage, and `from json --objects`/`from json`/`from nuon` conversion paths. Prove plugin/agent roles cannot perform authoritative PostgreSQL writes and envctl alone holds production commit capability.

*Verification:* Parity suite passes; write attempt from plugin role denied; envctl commit succeeds

### T172 · R08 · Enforce Nu-parse-before-plugin ordering

Insert `from json --objects`, `from json`, or `from nuon` before the nu_plugin_codedb child; native Nu bypasses RTK; MessagePack (MsgPackSerializer) is plugin protocol transport only, never described as redb encoding. R19 flags R08 unverified against nu_plugin @931d48f.

*Verification:* isolated registration, protocol trace, native bypass, typed/raw linkage tests

### T173 · R09 · Implement codedb ingest-envelope typed command

Registered plugin commands use `Nothing` input with no ingest-envelope; the required `codedb ingest-envelope` typed input/receipt command and owner-client backend are release blockers. R17: implemented at nu_plugin @931d48f (crates/codedb/src/ingest.rs, schema codedb.ingest-envelope.v0, tagged ARCHBP-001); invariant 16 gate not narrowed.

*Verification:* command inventory/signature test; JSON, JSONL, Nuon, native-Nu end-to-end fixtures; raw-link; PG denial

## Pin currency audit (observed 2026-07-23, verify pass)

- nu_plugin HEAD = 931d48f (`Merge pull request #41 … archbp-001-ingest-envelope`) — matches the R17 addendum pin exactly; R19's checkout-staleness for nu_plugin is resolved.
- Nushell = 0.113.1 — matches the blueprint's typed-boundary pin.
- Still outstanding: R08 (Nu-parse-before-plugin ordering) has not been verified against 931d48f.

## Progress Log

### 2026-07-24

- Sub-obligation resolved: the capture-policy engine (`crates/codedb_core/src/capture_policy.rs`)
  hard-rejected `configuration`/`sensitive`/`unknown` in every external policy, making
  hard rule 2 ("every byte") unreachable for those classes even with an
  operator-reviewed policy. Added optional external-policy fields
  `allow_extended=configuration,unknown` (never `sensitive` — parse-time
  `HardDeniedClassInPolicy`) and `classifier_uncertain=metadata-only|persist-raw`
  (default preserves prior behavior). `secret_detected` remains an unconditional,
  unoverridable guard — no policy field changes that outcome.
- Verified: `cargo test -p codedb-core` (21/21 capture_policy tests, 73/73 crate-wide),
  `cargo clippy -p codedb-core` clean, and an end-to-end run of a release-built `codedb`
  binary capturing a 2-file corpus (one plain unknown-class file, one configuration-class
  file containing a fake AWS access key) into the `codedb_outbox_test` PostgreSQL
  database with a maxed policy (`allow_extended` + `classifier_uncertain=persist-raw`):
  the plain file's raw blob landed in `codebase_codedb_blobs` byte-identical
  (`reason=authorized-extended-class`); the secret-bearing file produced zero blob rows
  (`reason=classifier-secret-detected`), proving the secret guard held even against a
  maximally-widened policy.
- Commit: nu_plugin branch `feat/policy-extended-classes` @ `1f1db59` (not pushed/merged).
- Caveat: this fixes the engine at HEAD. The Nix-packaged `codedb` binary this task's
  prior pin-currency audit and R-phase research verified against is a separate,
  older build (see `context-lifeos` ICM memory `01KY99ANTF66TZ9DVRBWHQTVC0`) and does
  not yet include this change — packaging/release of the updated binary is still
  outstanding and out of scope for this sub-obligation.
