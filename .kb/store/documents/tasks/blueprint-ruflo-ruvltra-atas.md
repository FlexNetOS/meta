## Overview

Component task in the blueprint-ingestion stream (parent: [[tasks/blueprint-ingestion-epic]]). Implements the
`ruflo-ruvltra-atas` component of
`/home/flexnetos/meta/src/lifeos/Architecture_Data_Pipeline_Blueprint_RUVECTOR_FULLY_EXPANDED_VERIFIED.md`.
Staged by Fable 5 for execution by Codex; claim by moving status to `active`.

## Goals

- Implement ATAS forecasting on isolated branches (RV§11)
- Keep learning and forecast promotion database-gated (A11)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement ATAS forecasting on isolated branches — verified by: Forecast rows carry observation-linked calibration; no branch pointer change originates from ATAS
- [ ] Keep learning and forecast promotion database-gated — verified by: seeded ensemble replay; predicted-versus-observed capture; no-self-promotion test

## Context

- **Execution order:** 9 (from the blueprint's numbered install/activation order, RV§17 / integration table). Do not start implementation before lower-numbered component tasks have their gates green; work within the same order number may run concurrently.
- **Depends on component tasks:** [[tasks/blueprint-postgres-ruvector-store]], [[tasks/blueprint-cow-branching]], [[tasks/blueprint-sona-rl]], [[tasks/blueprint-ruvllm-agentdb-rvf]]
- **Binding constraints:** the blueprint's 21 HARD EXECUTION RULES and 19 Operational invariants govern this task in full; the broader interpretation governs every ambiguity, and an edit conflicting with them is invalid. Read the blueprint sections named per obligation below before implementing.
- **Machine-readable source:** row(s) T114, T203 in `/home/flexnetos/meta/src/lifeos/reports/blueprint-task-graph.tsv`.
- **Operating constraint (owner directive):** previously completed planning-spine tasks and green test suites are untrusted claims until independently audited — lead with verification, not assumption.


## Obligations (full detail)

### T114 · RV§11 · Implement ATAS forecasting on isolated branches

ATAS (Agentic Temporal Attractor Studio) combines Echo-State Networks/reservoir computing, temporal strange attractors, coherence graphs, cut profiles, RuvLTRA temporal reasoning, RuVector temporal tensors, TimesFM, AgentDB episodes, RVF COW timelines, Ruflo ensembles, MinCut boundary isolation, and graph repair. Each forecast creates isolated future-timeline branches and ensemble simulations; actual outcomes return to the forecast record, update calibration, and train SONA/RL, preserving predicted-versus-observed history. Forecasts inform the decision gate and never self-promote a branch.

*Verification:* Forecast rows carry observation-linked calibration; no branch pointer change originates from ATAS

### T203 · A11 · Keep learning and forecast promotion database-gated

ruvllm, AgentDB, RVF, SONA/MicroLoRA, routing, and Ruflo/RuvLTRA/ATAS must return complete model/RVF bytes and forecast evidence; promotion remains database-gated with no self-promotion.

*Verification:* seeded ensemble replay; predicted-versus-observed capture; no-self-promotion test
